                    <b>Student Bio:</b><br>
                        I'm an aspiring developer that has moved across the country from Georgia to take part in this
                        class. I have always had an interest in all things electronic, but recently realized that my
                        passion was with developing. I spent 13 years as an IT professional.</p>

                    <p><b>Student Goals:</b><br>
                        My goal is to find a great company in the Portland area to develop for. My wife and I have
                        always wanted to live on the west coast, preferably here in Portland. Now we have a baby
                        daughter that we definitely want to raise here.

                    <b>Student Bio:</b><br>
                        I left Portland at the age of 18 seeking knowledge. This took me to Chicago, Philadelphia,
                        India, Pakistan, Toronto and Oxford before Portland called me back. In the course of my journeys
                        I picked up a Ph.D. and was a postdoctoral fellow at The University of Chicago and the
                        University of Oxford. I am passionate about education, technology and innovation. </p>

                    <p><b>Student Goals:</b><br>
                        A few years ago I had an idea for a startup. The idea was to use the transportation resources we
                        have to get cars off the roads, build community and transform the ways in which we view
                        transport. Practically this meant creating an app that would connect drivers with riders in real
                        time who were heading in the same direction or starting from similar points. Because I was soon
                        to move out of Chicago to England I wasn't in a position to pursue my idea until moving back to
                        Portland in the summer of 2014. I quickly realized that if I wanted to make my dream a reality I
                        would need to learn to code. I found PDX Code Guild and enrolled in the Python developer course.
                        My goal is to learn enough to recruit the right team and create a prototype for my new business,
                        PoolRyde.

                        Business Manager, strategizing the digital agenda and analyzing legal risk of the balance
                        transfer credit card business. I have an MBA from MIT Sloan and a BA from Brown University and
                        am currently interested in developer opportunities.</p>

                    <b>Student Bio:</b><br>
                        I hope to gain an understanding of the precepts of programming, full stack-- front end, server
                        side, and database-- through hands-on creation. I also want to finish the first stages of a
                        larger project: an interactive web application that will serve as a one-stop resource for
                        homeless people in Portland.</p>

                    <p><b>Student Goals:</b><br>
                        I want to combine my creative side with my programming skills to make beautiful modern web applications.  Providing equal access to technology is a passion of mine.

                    <b>Student Bio:</b><br>
                        I have been a service industry worker for the last twenty years. A bartender, server and cab
                        driver; I've done it all. Debugging, testing, and being stuck on a really hard problem can't wind me up.  I'm also a musician and artist, and want to bring in my creative side in making unique apps.  I'm particularly interested in working with geolocation data with PostGIS and GeoDjango.</p>

                    <p><b>Student Goals:</b><br>
                        My goal is to develop a whole new skill set in order to find a career in the tech industry.
